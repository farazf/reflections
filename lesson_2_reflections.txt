What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder will be created to keep the track of files inside my repository.

***
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

working place is just a directory in which our files are placed. Staging area is the place which is monitored by git.

***
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Before starting new changes, we can add the file to the staging area and when we are done with
new changes we can commit.
