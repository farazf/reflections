When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1- If I do not have an access to my computer.
	2- If there is more than one contributor to a project.
	3- If I want to have a backup of my works.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We might not want to have others changes on our machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork copies the remote repository into another remote repository.
	Clone copies the remote repository into the local repository.
	Branch copies commit into another another branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can compare it to our existing code, merge it manually. Generally, we have more control over codes stored locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I will use SVN. GitHub would be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If I want to add a new feature or fix a bug, or make an alternative solution to the problem, or when I am collaborating with other people.
	I still have my stable code, also it decreases the odds of making mistakes or creating a bug.
